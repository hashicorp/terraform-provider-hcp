# hcp_vault_radar_resource_iam_policy (Resource)

-> **Note:** This feature is currently in private beta.

Sets the Vault Radar Resource IAM policy and replaces any existing policy.

`hcp_vault_radar_resource_iam_binding`.

that can be applied to a policy and/or binding for Vault Radar resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "organization_id" {
  type = string
}

data "hcp_group" "group" {
  resource_name = "iam/organization/${var.organization_id}/group/dev-group"
}

# Note: `roles/vault-radar.resource-viewer` and `roles/vault-radar.resource-contributor` are the only roles
# that can be applied to a policy and/or binding for Vault Radar resources.
data "hcp_iam_policy" "policy" {
  bindings = [{
    role       = "roles/vault-radar.resource-viewer"
    principals = [hcp_group.group.resource_id]
  }]
}

resource "hcp_vault_radar_resource_iam_policy" "policy" {
  resource_name = "vault-radar/project/<project_id>/scan-target/<scan_target_id>"
  policy_data   = data.hcp_iam_policy.policy.policy_data
