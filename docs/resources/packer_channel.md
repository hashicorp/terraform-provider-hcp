# hcp_packer_channel (Resource)

-> **Note:** This resource is currently in public beta.

The Packer Channel resource allows you to manage image bucket channels within an active HCP Packer Registry.

## Example Usage

To create a channel with no assigned iteration.
```terraform
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
}
```

To create, or update an existing, channel with an assigned iteration.
```terraform
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  iteration {
    id = "iteration-id"
  }
}

# Update assigned iteration using an iteration fingerprint
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  iteration {
    fingerprint = "fingerprint-associated-to-iteration"
  }
}

# Update assigned iteration using an iteration incremental version
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  iteration {
    // incremental_version is the version number assigned to a completed iteration.
    incremental_version = 1
  }
}
```

Using the latest channel to create a new channel with an assigned iteration.
```terraform
data "hcp_packer_image_iteration" "latest" {
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  channel     = "latest"
}

resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = staging
  bucket_name = alpine
  iteration {
    id = data.hcp_packer_image_iteration.latest.id
  }
}
```
