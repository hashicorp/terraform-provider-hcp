# hcp_packer_channel (Resource)

The Packer Channel resource allows you to manage image bucket channels within an active HCP Packer Registry.

## Example Usage

To create a channel.
```terraform
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
}
```

To create a channel with iteration assignment managed by Terraform.
```terraform
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  iteration {
    # Exactly one of `id`, `fingerprint` or `incremental_version` must be passed
    id = "01H1SF9NWAK8AP25PAWDBGZ1YD"
    # fingerprint = "01H1ZMW0Q2W6FT4FK27FQJCFG7"
    # incremental_version = 1
  }
}

# To configure a channel to have no assigned iteration, use a "zero value".
# The zero value for `id` and `fingerprint` is `""`; for `incremental_version`, it is `0`
resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = "staging"
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  iteration {
    # Exactly one of `id`, `fingerprint` or `incremental_version` must be passed
    id = ""
    # fingerprint = ""
    # incremental_version = 0
  }
}
```

Using the latest channel to create a new channel with the latest complete iteration assigned.
```terraform
data "hcp_packer_image_iteration" "latest" {
  bucket_name = "alpine"
  channel     = "latest"
}

resource "hcp_packer_channel" "staging" {
  name        = staging
  bucket_name = alpine
  iteration {
    id = data.hcp_packer_image_iteration.latest.id
  }
}
```
