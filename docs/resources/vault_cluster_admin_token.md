# hcp_vault_cluster_admin_token (Resource)

~> **Security Notice:** Please see this [list of recommendations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html) for storing sensitive information in Terraform.

~> **Known Issue:** An admin token may be generated during a `terraform plan` if the current token is expiring. 
Since the Plan phase does not save any state, the Apply phase saves a different generated token, and the token generated during Plan ends up orphaned. 
It will expire in six hours.

The Vault cluster admin token resource generates an admin-level token for the HCP Vault cluster.

This resource saves a single admin token per Vault cluster and auto-refreshes the token when it is about to expire.
Destroying this resource *does not* invalidate the admin token.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_vault_cluster_admin_token" "example" {
  cluster_id = "test-vault-cluster"
}
```
