## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_vault_secrets_integration_gcp" "example_with_federated_identity" {
  name         = "my-gcp-1"
  capabilities = ["DYNAMIC", "ROTATION"]
  federated_workload_identity = {
    service_account_email = "my-service-account@my-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    audience              = "https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-identity-pool/providers/my-provider"
  }
}

resource "hcp_vault_secrets_integration_gcp" "example_with_base64_service_account_key" {
  name         = "my-gcp-2"
  capabilities = ["DYNAMIC", "ROTATION"]
  service_account_key = {
    credentials = filebase64("${path.module}/service_account_key.json")
  }
}


resource "hcp_vault_secrets_integration_gcp" "example_json_service_account_key" {

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Vault Secrets GCP Integration can be imported by specifying the name of the integration
# Note that since the service account credentials are never returned on the Vault Secrets API,
# the next plan or apply will show a diff for that field if using the service account key authentication method.
terraform import hcp_vault_secrets_integration_gcp.example my-gcp-1
```
