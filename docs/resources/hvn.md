# hcp_hvn (Resource)

The HVN resource allows you to manage a HashiCorp Virtual Network in HCP.

We recommend the following when selecting the CIDR block of an HVN:

- If the CIDR block values for your HVN and VPCs overlap, then you will not be able to establish a connection. Ensure that any VPCs you plan to connect do not have overlapping values.

- The default HVN CIDR block value does not overlap with the default CIDR block value for AWS VPCs (172.31.0.0/16). However, if you are planning to use this HVN in production, we recommend adding a custom value instead of using the default.

- The CIDR block value must end between /16 and /25.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = "main-hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}
```
