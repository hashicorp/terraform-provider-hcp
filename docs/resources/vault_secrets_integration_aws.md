### Nested Schema for `access_keys`

Required:

- `access_key_id` (String) Key ID used with the secret key to authenticate against the target AWS account.
- `secret_access_key` (String, Sensitive) Secret key used with the key ID to authenticate against the target AWS account.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Vault Secrets AWS Integration can be imported by specifying the name of the integration
# Note that since the AWS secret access key is never returned on the Vault Secrets API,
# the next plan or apply will show a diff for that field if using the access keys authentication method.
terraform import hcp_vault_secrets_integration_aws.example my-aws-1
```
