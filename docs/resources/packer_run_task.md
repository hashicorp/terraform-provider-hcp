# hcp_packer_run_task (Resource)

-> **Note:** This resource is currently in public beta.

The Packer Run Task resource allows you to regenerate the HMAC key for an HCP Packer Registry's run task.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_packer_run_task" "registry1" {}

# Configuring the HMAC Key to regenerate on apply
# NOTE: `regenerate_hmac` should be set to `false` (or removed from the config
# entirely) after a successful apply, to avoid constant regeneration.
resource "hcp_packer_run_task" "registry1" {
  regenerate_hmac = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the HCP project where the HCP Packer Registry is located. 
If not specified, the project specified in the HCP Provider config block will be used, if configured.
If a project is not configured in the HCP Provider config block, the oldest project in the organization will be used.
- `regenerate_hmac` (Boolean) If true, the HMAC Key (`hmac_key`) will be regenerated during `terraform apply` and the resource will always cause a non-empty plan. Changing `regenerate_hmac` to false (or removing it from the config) should not result in a plan.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `endpoint_url` (String) A unique HCP Packer URL, specific to your HCP organization and HCP Packer registry. The Terraform Cloud run task will send a payload to this URL for image validation.
- `hmac_key` (String, Sensitive) A secret key that lets HCP Packer verify the run task request.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the HCP organization where this channel is located. Always the same as the associated channel.
