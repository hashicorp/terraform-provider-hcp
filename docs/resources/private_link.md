# hcp_private_link (Resource)

The private link resource allows you to manage a private link within an HVN.

-> **Note:** For more details and requirements, see the HCP Vault Private Link documentation: [HCP Vault Private Link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/aws-privatelink)

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create an HVN
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = "private-link-hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}

# Create a Vault cluster
resource "hcp_vault_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_id      = "vault-cluster"
  hvn_id          = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  tier            = "standard_small"
  public_endpoint = false

  major_version_upgrade_config {
    upgrade_type = "AUTOMATIC"
  }
}

# Create a Private Link for the Vault cluster
resource "hcp_private_link" "example" {
  hvn_id           = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  private_link_id  = "example-private-link"
  vault_cluster_id = hcp_vault_cluster.example.cluster_id

  # AWS account IDs allowed to connect to this private link
  consumer_accounts = [
    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
  ]

  # AWS regions from which you can connect to this private link
  consumer_regions = [
    "us-west-2",
    "us-east-1"
  ]

  # IP ranges allowed to connect to the Vault cluster
  consumer_ip_ranges = [
    "10.0.0.0/16",
    "192.168.1.0/24"
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `hvn_id` (String) The ID of the HVN associated with the private link.
- `private_link_id` (String) The ID of the private link.
- `vault_cluster_id` (String) The ID of the HCP Vault cluster associated with the private link.

### Optional

- `consumer_accounts` (List of String) The list of consumer accounts allowed to connect to the private link. In AWS, these are IAM Principals. In Azure, these are Azure Subscription/Resource IDs.
- `consumer_ip_ranges` (List of String) The list of consumer IP ranges or CIDRs allowed to connect to the HVD cluster associated with the private link.
- `consumer_regions` (List of String) The cloud provider regions from which consumers can connect to the private link.
- `project_id` (String) The ID of the HCP project where the private link is located. If not specified, the project configured in the provider is used.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The time that the private link was created.
- `default_region` (String) The default region for the private link, which is the HVN region. This is automatically added as a consumer region.
- `external_name` (String) The private link name generated by the cloud provider. In AWS, this is the name of the VPC Endpoint Service.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the HCP organization where the private link is located.
- `self_link` (String) A unique URL identifying the private link.
- `state` (String) The state of the private link.
- `updated_at` (String) The time that the private link was last updated.

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `default` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `update` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Using an explicit project ID, the import ID is:
# {project_id}:{hvn_id}:{private_link_id}
terraform import hcp_private_link.example f709ec73-55d4-46d8-897d-816ebba28778:private-link-hvn:example-private-link
# Using the provider-default project ID, the import ID is:
# {hvn_id}:{private_link_id}
terraform import hcp_private_link.example private-link-hvn:example-private-link
```
