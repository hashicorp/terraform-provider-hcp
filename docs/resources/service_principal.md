}
```

  name = "example"
}

resource "hcp_service_principal" "example" {
  name   = "example-sp"
  parent = hcp_project.my_proj.resource_name
}
```

## Example Usage: Create organization service principal

```terraform
data "hcp_organization" "my_org" {
}

resource "hcp_service_principal" "example" {
