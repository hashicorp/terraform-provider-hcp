The user or service account that is running Terraform when creating a `hcp_service_principal` resource must have `roles/admin` on the parent resource; either the project or organization.

## Example Usage: Create in provider configured project

```terraform
resource "hcp_service_principal" "example" {
  name = "example-sp"
}
```

## Example Usage: Create in new project

```terraform
resource "hcp_project" "my_proj" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "hcp_service_principal" "example" {
  name   = "example-sp"
  parent = hcp_project.my_proj.resource_name
}
```

## Example Usage: Create organization service principal

```terraform
data "hcp_organization" "my_org" {
}

resource "hcp_service_principal" "example" {
  name   = "example-sp"
  parent = data.hcp_organization.my_org.resource_name
