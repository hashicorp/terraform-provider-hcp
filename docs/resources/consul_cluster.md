# hcp_consul_cluster (Resource)

The Consul cluster resource allows you to manage an HCP Consul cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = "hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}

resource "hcp_consul_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_id = "consul-cluster"
  hvn_id     = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  tier       = "development"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **cluster_id** (String) The ID of the HCP Consul cluster.
- **hvn_id** (String) The ID of the HVN this HCP Consul cluster is associated to.
- **tier** (String) The tier that the HCP Consul cluster will be provisioned as.  Only `development`, `standard` and `plus` are available at this time. See [pricing information](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing/consul).

### Optional

- **auto_hvn_to_hvn_peering** (Boolean) Enables automatic HVN to HVN peering when creating a secondary cluster in a federation. The alternative to using the auto-accept feature is to create an [`hcp_hvn_peering_connection`](hvn_peering_connection.md) resource that explicitly defines the HVN resources that are allowed to communicate with each other.
- **connect_enabled** (Boolean) Denotes the Consul connect feature should be enabled for this cluster.  Default to true.
- **datacenter** (String) The Consul data center name of the cluster. If not specified, it is defaulted to the value of `cluster_id`.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **min_consul_version** (String) The minimum Consul version of the cluster. If not specified, it is defaulted to the version that is currently recommended by HCP.
- **primary_link** (String) The `self_link` of the HCP Consul cluster which is the primary in the federation setup with this HCP Consul cluster. If not specified, it is a standalone cluster.
- **public_endpoint** (Boolean) Denotes that the cluster has a public endpoint for the Consul UI. Defaults to false.
- **size** (String) The t-shirt size representation of each server VM that this Consul cluster is provisioned with. Valid option for development tier - `x_small`. Valid options for other tiers - `small`, `medium`, `large`. For more details - https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing/consul. Upgrading the size of a cluster after creation is allowed.
- **timeouts** (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- **cloud_provider** (String) The provider where the HCP Consul cluster is located.
- **consul_automatic_upgrades** (Boolean) Denotes that automatic Consul upgrades are enabled.
- **consul_ca_file** (String) The cluster CA file encoded as a Base64 string.
- **consul_config_file** (String) The cluster config encoded as a Base64 string.
- **consul_private_endpoint_url** (String) The private URL for the Consul UI.
- **consul_public_endpoint_url** (String) The public URL for the Consul UI. This will be empty if `public_endpoint` is `false`.
- **consul_root_token_accessor_id** (String) The accessor ID of the root ACL token that is generated upon cluster creation. If a new root token is generated using the `hcp_consul_root_token` resource, this field is no longer valid.
- **consul_root_token_secret_id** (String, Sensitive) The secret ID of the root ACL token that is generated upon cluster creation. If a new root token is generated using the `hcp_consul_root_token` resource, this field is no longer valid.
- **consul_snapshot_interval** (String) The Consul snapshot interval.
- **consul_snapshot_retention** (String) The retention policy for Consul snapshots.
- **consul_version** (String) The Consul version of the cluster.
- **organization_id** (String) The ID of the organization this HCP Consul cluster is located in.
- **project_id** (String) The ID of the project this HCP Consul cluster is located in.
- **region** (String) The region where the HCP Consul cluster is located.
- **scale** (Number) The number of Consul server nodes in the cluster.
- **self_link** (String) A unique URL identifying the HCP Consul cluster.
