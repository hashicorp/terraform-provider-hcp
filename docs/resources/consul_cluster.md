# hcp_consul_cluster (Resource)

The Consul cluster resource allows you to manage an HCP Consul cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = "hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}

resource "hcp_consul_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_id = "consul-cluster"
  hvn_id     = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  tier       = "development"
}
```

-> **Note:** The `primary_link` attribute is related to federation, a feature that is currently in private beta.

## Schema

### Required

- **cluster_id** (String) The ID of the HCP Consul cluster.
- **hvn_id** (String) The ID of the HVN this HCP Consul cluster is associated to.
- **tier** (String) The tier that the HCP Consul cluster will be provisioned as.  Only `development` and `standard` are available at this time.

### Optional

- **connect_enabled** (Boolean) Denotes the Consul connect feature should be enabled for this cluster.  Default to true.
- **datacenter** (String) The Consul data center name of the cluster. If not specified, it is defaulted to the value of `cluster_id`.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **min_consul_version** (String) The minimum Consul version of the cluster. If not specified, it is defaulted to the version that is currently recommended by HCP.
- **primary_link** (String) The `self_link` of the HCP Consul cluster which is the primary in the federation setup with this HCP Consul cluster. If not specified, it is a standalone cluster.
- **public_endpoint** (Boolean) Denotes that the cluster has a public endpoint for the Consul UI. Defaults to false.
- **size** (String) The t-shirt size representation of each server VM that this Consul cluster is provisioned with. Valid option for development tier - `x_small`. Valid options for other tiers - `small`, `medium`, `large`. For more details - https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing/consul
- **timeouts** (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only
