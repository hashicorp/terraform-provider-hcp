# hcp_dns_forwarding (Resource)

The DNS forwarding resource allows you to manage DNS forwarding configurations for HVNs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_dns_forwarding" "example" {
  hvn_id            = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  dns_forwarding_id = "dns-forwarding-1"
  peering_id        = hcp_aws_network_peering.example.peering_id
  connection_type   = "PEERING"
  
  forwarding_rule {
    rule_id              = "rule-1"
    domain_name          = "example.com"
    inbound_endpoint_ips = ["10.0.1.10", "10.0.1.11"]
  }
}
```
