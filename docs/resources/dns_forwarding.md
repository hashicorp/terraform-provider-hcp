# hcp_dns_forwarding (Resource)

The DNS forwarding resource allows you to manage DNS forwarding configurations for HVNs.

-> **Note:** For more details and requirements, see the HCP Vault Private DNS documentation: [HCP Vault Private DNS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/private-dns)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcp_dns_forwarding" "example" {
  hvn_id            = var.hvn_id
  dns_forwarding_id = "example-dns-forwarding"
  peering_id        = var.peering_id
  connection_type   = "hvn-peering"

  forwarding_rule {
    domain_name          = "example.com"
    inbound_endpoint_ips = ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]
  }
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Using an explicit project ID, the import ID is:
# {project_id}:{hvn_id}:{dns_forwarding_id}
terraform import hcp_dns_forwarding.example f709ec73-55d4-46d8-897d-816ebba28778:main-hvn:example-dns-forwarding
# Using the provider-default project ID, the import ID is:
# {hvn_id}:{dns_forwarding_id}
terraform import hcp_dns_forwarding.example main-hvn:example-dns-forwarding
```
