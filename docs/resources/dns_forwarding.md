# hcp_dns_forwarding (Resource)

The DNS forwarding resource allows you to manage DNS forwarding configurations for HVNs. Configure private DNS to forward DNS queries from your HVN to your private DNS servers.

## Prerequisites

Before using DNS forwarding, ensure you have:

- **HVN**: AWS HVN with unique address space
- **VPC Configuration**: Target VPC with DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled
- **Network Connectivity**: Valid connection via VPC peering or Transit Gateway
- **Security Groups**: Allow inbound traffic on port 53 (UDP/TCP) from HVN CIDR
- **DNS Setup**: Route 53 resolver endpoint or self-managed DNS server

Check the [HCP Private DNS documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/private-dns) for more details.

## Resource Usage

### When to Use This Resource

Use `hcp_dns_forwarding` with embedded rule when:
- Creating a single DNS forwarding configuration with one rule
- Simple, straightforward setup
- Rule is tightly coupled to the DNS forwarding configuration

For multiple rules in the same DNS forwarding configuration, use the `hcp_dns_forwarding_rule` resource to add additional rules after the initial configuration is created.

## Example Usage

### Basic DNS Forwarding with VPC Peering

```terraform
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = "main-hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}

resource "hcp_aws_network_peering" "example" {
  hvn_id          = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  peering_id      = "main-peering"
  peer_vpc_id     = "vpc-12345678"
  peer_account_id = "123456789012"
  peer_vpc_region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "hcp_dns_forwarding" "example" {
  hvn_id            = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  dns_forwarding_id = "dns-forwarding-1"
  peering_id        = hcp_aws_network_peering.example.peering_id
  connection_type   = "hvn-peering"
  
  forwarding_rule {
    rule_id              = "rule-1"
    domain_name          = "internal.example.com"
    inbound_endpoint_ips = ["10.0.1.10", "10.0.1.11"]
  }
}
```

### DNS Forwarding with Transit Gateway

```terraform
resource "hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment" "example" {
  hvn_id                        = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  transit_gateway_attachment_id = "main-tgw-attachment"
  transit_gateway_id            = "tgw-12345678"
  resource_share_arn            = "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/example"
}

resource "hcp_dns_forwarding" "tgw_example" {
  hvn_id            = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  dns_forwarding_id = "dns-forwarding-tgw"
  peering_id        = hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment.example.id
  connection_type   = "tgw-attachment"
  
  forwarding_rule {
    rule_id              = "tgw-rule-1"
    domain_name          = "internal.company.com"
    inbound_endpoint_ips = ["10.0.2.10", "10.0.2.11"]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_type` (String) The connection type for DNS forwarding. Valid values: `hvn-peering` (for VPC peering connections) or `tgw-attachment` (for Transit Gateway attachments).
- `dns_forwarding_id` (String) The ID of the DNS forwarding configuration. Must be unique across your HCP account and cannot exceed 32 characters.
- `forwarding_rule` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The forwarding rule configuration. Only one rule per DNS forwarding resource is supported. For multiple rules, use separate `hcp_dns_forwarding_rule` resources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--forwarding_rule))
- `hvn_id` (String) The ID of the HVN that this DNS forwarding belongs to.
- `peering_id` (String) The ID of the peering connection (for `hvn-peering`) or transit gateway attachment ID (for `tgw-attachment`) for DNS forwarding.

### Optional

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the HCP project where the DNS forwarding is located. If not specified, the project specified in the HCP Provider config block will be used, if configured. If a project is not configured in the HCP Provider config block, the oldest project in the organization will be used.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The time that the DNS forwarding configuration was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `self_link` (String) A unique URL identifying the DNS forwarding configuration.
- `state` (String) The state of the DNS forwarding configuration.

<a id="nestedblock--forwarding_rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `forwarding_rule`

Required:

- `domain_name` (String) The domain name for DNS forwarding (e.g., `internal.example.com`).
- `inbound_endpoint_ips` (List of String) The IP addresses of your DNS servers or AWS Route 53 VPC endpoint. Maximum 2 IPs per rule.
- `rule_id` (String) The ID of the forwarding rule. Must be unique across your HCP account and cannot exceed 32 characters.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `default` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Using provider-default project ID
terraform import hcp_dns_forwarding.example hvn-id:dns-forwarding-id

# Using explicit project ID  
terraform import hcp_dns_forwarding.example project-id:hvn-id:dns-forwarding-id
```

## Limitations

- **Beta Feature**: Private DNS forwarding is currently in beta for AWS only
- **Resource Limits**: 1 DNS forwarding configuration per HVN, 5 rules per configuration, 2 IPs per rule
- **Immutable**: DNS forwarding configurations cannot be updated after creation (changes require replacement)
- **Connection Types**: Only `hvn-peering` and `tgw-attachment` are supported
- **TLS Limitations**: TLS certificates from private certificate authorities are not supported during beta

For higher limits, [create a support ticket](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
