# hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment (Resource)

~> **Security Notice:** This resource contains sensitive input. Please see this [list of recommendations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html) for storing sensitive information in Terraform.

The AWS transit gateway attachment resource allows you to manage a transit gateway attachment. The transit gateway attachment attaches an HVN to a user-owned transit gateway in AWS. Note that the HVN and transit gateway must be located in the same AWS region.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "hcp_hvn" "main" {
  hvn_id         = "main-hvn"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  cidr_block     = "172.25.16.0/20"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "172.31.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway" "example" {
  tags = {
    Name = "example-tgw"
  }
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_share" "example" {
  name                      = "example-resource-share"
  allow_external_principals = true
}

resource "aws_ram_principal_association" "example" {
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn
  principal          = hcp_hvn.main.provider_account_id
}

resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "example" {
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn
  resource_arn       = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.example.arn
}

resource "hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment" "example" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_ram_principal_association.example,
    aws_ram_resource_association.example,
  ]

  hvn_id                        = hcp_hvn.main.hvn_id
  transit_gateway_attachment_id = "example-tgw-attachment"
  transit_gateway_id            = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id
  resource_share_arn            = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn
}

resource "hcp_hvn_route" "route" {
  hvn_link         = hcp_hvn.main.self_link
  hvn_route_id     = "hvn-to-tgw-attachment"
  destination_cidr = aws_vpc.example.cidr_block
  target_link      = hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment.example.self_link
}

resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment_accepter" "example" {
  transit_gateway_attachment_id = hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment.example.provider_transit_gateway_attachment_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **hvn_id** (String) The ID of the HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).
- **resource_share_arn** (String, Sensitive) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Share that is needed to grant HCP access to the transit gateway in AWS. The Resource Share should be associated with the HCP AWS account principal (see [aws_ram_principal_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ram_principal_association)) and the transit gateway resource (see [aws_ram_resource_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ram_resource_association))
- **transit_gateway_attachment_id** (String) The user-settable name of the transit gateway attachment in HCP.
- **transit_gateway_id** (String) The ID of the user-owned transit gateway in AWS. The AWS region of the transit gateway must match the HVN.

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **timeouts** (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- **created_at** (String) The time that the transit gateway attachment was created.
- **expires_at** (String) The time after which the transit gateway attachment will be considered expired if it hasn't transitioned into `ACCEPTED` or `ACTIVE` state.
- **organization_id** (String) The ID of the HCP organization where the transit gateway attachment is located. Always matches the HVN's organization.
- **project_id** (String) The ID of the HCP project where the transit gateway attachment is located. Always matches the HVN's project.
- **provider_transit_gateway_attachment_id** (String) The transit gateway attachment ID used by AWS.
- **self_link** (String) A unique URL identifying the transit gateway attachment.
- **state** (String) The state of the transit gateway attachment.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- **create** (String)
- **default** (String)
- **delete** (String)

## Import

-> **Note:** When importing a transit gateway attachment, you will want to configure a `lifecycle` configuration block with an `ignore_changes` argument including `resource_share_arn`. This is needed because its value is no longer retrievable after creation.

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The import ID is {hvn_id}:{transit_gateway_attachment_id}
terraform import hcp_aws_transit_gateway_attachment.example main-hvn:example-tgw-attachment
```
