# hcp_iam_policy (Data Source)

Generates an IAM policy that may be referenced by and applied to other HCP IAM resources, such as the `hcp_project_iam_policy` resource.

To see what each role grants, please see [HCP
Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#organization).
The basic roles can be referenced as follows:

* `roles/owner`
* `roles/admin`
* `roles/contributor`
* `roles/viewer`

You can now assign HCP Vault Secrets specific roles, please see [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#project)
* `roles/secrets.app-manager`
* `roles/secrets.app-secret-reader`


## Example Usage

```terraform
data "hcp_iam_policy" "example" {
  bindings = [
    {
      role = "roles/admin"
      principals = [
        "example-user-id-1",
        "example-group-id-1",
        "example-sp-1"
      ]
    },
    {
      role = "roles/contributor"
      principals = [
        "example-user-id-2",
        "example-group-id-2",
      ]
    },
    {
      role = "roles/secrets.app-secret-reader"
      principals = [
