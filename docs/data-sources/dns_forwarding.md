# hcp_dns_forwarding (Data Source)

The DNS forwarding data source provides information about an existing DNS forwarding configuration for a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN). Use this to reference existing DNS forwarding configurations when adding additional rules.

## Example Usage

### Basic Data Source Usage

```terraform
data "hcp_dns_forwarding" "example" {
  hvn_id            = "main-hvn"
  dns_forwarding_id = "existing-dns-forwarding"
}

# Use the data source to add additional rules
resource "hcp_dns_forwarding_rule" "additional" {
  hvn_id            = data.hcp_dns_forwarding.example.hvn_id
  dns_forwarding_id = data.hcp_dns_forwarding.example.dns_forwarding_id
  domain_name       = "api.internal.com"
  inbound_endpoint_ips = ["10.0.1.12", "10.0.1.13"]
}

# Output information about the DNS forwarding
output "dns_forwarding_info" {
  value = {
    state           = data.hcp_dns_forwarding.example.state
    connection_type = data.hcp_dns_forwarding.example.connection_type
    rules_count     = length(data.hcp_dns_forwarding.example.forwarding_rules)
  }
}
```

### With Explicit Project ID

```terraform
data "hcp_dns_forwarding" "example" {
  hvn_id            = "main-hvn"
  dns_forwarding_id = "existing-dns-forwarding"
  project_id        = "f709ec73-55d4-46d8-897d-816ebba28778"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dns_forwarding_id` (String) The ID of the DNS forwarding.
- `hvn_id` (String) The ID of the HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).

### Optional

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the HCP project where the DNS forwarding is located. If not specified, the project specified in the HCP Provider config block will be used, if configured. If a project is not configured in the HCP Provider config block, the oldest project in the organization will be used.

### Read-Only

- `connection_type` (String) The type of connection.
- `created_at` (String) The time that the DNS forwarding was created.
- `forwarding_rules` (List of Object) The forwarding rules for the DNS forwarding. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--forwarding_rules))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the HCP organization where the DNS forwarding is located.
- `peering_id` (String) The ID of the peering connection or transit gateway attachment.
- `self_link` (String) A unique URL identifying the DNS forwarding configuration.
- `state` (String) The state of the DNS forwarding.
- `updated_at` (String) The time that the DNS forwarding was last updated.

### Nested Schema for `forwarding_rules`

Read-Only:

- `domain_name` (String) The domain name for DNS forwarding.
- `inbound_endpoint_ips` (List of String) The list of inbound endpoint IP addresses.
- `rule_id` (String) The ID of the forwarding rule.
