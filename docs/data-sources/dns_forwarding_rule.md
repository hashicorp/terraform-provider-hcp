# hcp_dns_forwarding_rule (Data Source)

The DNS forwarding rule data source provides information about an existing DNS forwarding rule within a DNS forwarding configuration.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
data "hcp_dns_forwarding_rule" "example" {
  hvn_id                  = "main-hvn"
  dns_forwarding_id       = "existing-dns-forwarding"
  dns_forwarding_rule_id  = "staging-rule"
}

# Use the rule information
output "rule_info" {
  value = {
    domain      = data.hcp_dns_forwarding_rule.example.domain_name
    target_ips  = data.hcp_dns_forwarding_rule.example.inbound_endpoint_ips
    state       = data.hcp_dns_forwarding_rule.example.state
  }
}
```

### With Explicit Project ID

```terraform
data "hcp_dns_forwarding_rule" "example" {
  hvn_id                  = "main-hvn"
  dns_forwarding_id       = "existing-dns-forwarding"
  dns_forwarding_rule_id  = "production-rule"
  project_id              = "f709ec73-55d4-46d8-897d-816ebba28778"
}
```
