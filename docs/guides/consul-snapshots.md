# Create Consul cluster snapshots

The snapshot resource allows users to manage Consul snapshots of an HCP cluster. Snapshots currently have a retention policy of 30 days.

Restoring snapshots via Terraform is not supported.  If you would like to restore a snapshot for your Consul cluster, navigate to the snapshots page via the HCP UI.

This can be done by navigating from the Consul list page to the cluster detail page and then in turn the snapshots tab within that view.
```terraform
resource "hcp_hvn" "example" {
  hvn_id         = var.hvn_id
  cloud_provider = var.cloud_provider
  region         = var.region
}

resource "hcp_consul_cluster" "example" {
  hvn_id     = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  cluster_id = var.cluster_id
  tier       = "development"
}

resource "hcp_consul_snapshot" "example" {
  cluster_id    = hcp_consul_cluster.example.cluster_id
  snapshot_name = var.snapshot_name
}
```
