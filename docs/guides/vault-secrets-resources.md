    Manage Vault Secrets apps and resources.

The HCP Provider allows you to manage your Vault Secrets apps and secrets.

The Vault Secrets app resource allows you to manage your application through the following configuration: 

```terraform
resource "hcp_vault_secrets_app" "example" {
  app_name    = "example-app-name"
  description = "My new app!"
}
```

We can also use this to create secrets based off our new application.

```terraform
resource "hcp_vault_secrets_app" "example" {
  app_name    = "example-app-name"
  description = "My new app!"
}
resource "hcp_vault_secrets_secret" "secret-example" {
  app_name     = hcp.hcp_vault_secrets_app.example.app_name
  secret_name  = "a-new-secret"
  secret_value = "a test secret"
}
```

-> **Note:** The secret value is considered sensitive and will be masked with any output. However, the secret value will be written to your state file and we recommend treating the [state file as sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data)
