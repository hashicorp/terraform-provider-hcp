# Authenticate with HCP

The HCP provider accepts client credentials, which are obtained on the creation of a service principal key.

## Service principal credentials

Service principals and service principal keys can be created in the HCP portal with an existing user account.

### Create a service principal

Once you have registered and logged into the HCP portal, navigate to the Access Control (IAM) page. Select the Service Principals tab and create a new service principal. Give it the role Contributor, since it will be writing resources.

### Create a service principal key

Once the service principal is created, navigate to its detail page by selecting its name in the list. Create a new service principal key.

-> **Note:** Save the client ID and secret returned on successful key creation. The client secret will not be available after creation.

### Two options to configure the provider

Save the client ID and secret as the environment variables HCP_CLIENT_ID and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET.

Or, configure the provider with the client ID and secret by copy-pasting the values directly into provider config.

```terraform
// Credentials can be set explicitly or via the environment variables HCP_CLIENT_ID and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET
provider "hcp" {
  client_id     = "service-principal-key-client-id"
  client_secret = "service-principal-key-client-secret"
}
``` 

## User session with browser login

The HCP provider supports logging in via the browser. To enable automatic browser login, you must leave client credentials unset and pin the provider to version 0.45.0 or above.

Upon running `terraform apply` or `terraform plan`, your web browser will navigate to the HCP portal, where you will be prompted to login. Once logged in, you may create new or manage existing resources fully authenticated. Your session will last 24 hours before prompting you to reauthenticate.

```terraform
// If no credentials are set, a user session can be obtained through browser login.
provider "hcp" {}
```
