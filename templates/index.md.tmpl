# HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Provider

The HCP provider provides resources to manage [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/) (HCP) resources.

~> **Known Issue** There is an issue with v0.4.0 of the HCP Provider in which existing Consul clusters that do not specify size will be force-recreated on the next Apply. Please upgrade to the patch v0.4.1 to avoid this issue.

## Authenticating with HCP

The HCP provider supports authentication via a Client ID and a Client Secret. The [authentication guide](guides/auth.md) describes how to obtain client credentials.

## Example Usage

Most HCP resources have a dependency on the Hashicorp Virtual Network (HVN) resource. 
We suggest referring to the HVN using an expression (`hvn_id = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id`) or the `depends_on` meta-argument, rather than a string, to ensure
Terraform detects that dependency.
