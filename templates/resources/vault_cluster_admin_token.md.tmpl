# {{.Name}} `{{.Type}}`

~> **Important Security Notice** The admin token generated by this resource will
be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file. **Use of this resource
for production deployments is *not* recommended**. Instead, generate
an admin token outside of Terraform and distribute it securely
to the system where Terraform will be run.

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

This resource saves a single admin token per Vault cluster and auto-refreshes the token when it is about to expire.
Destroying this resource *does not* invalidate the admin token.

~> **Known Issue** An admin token may be generated during a `terraform plan` if the current token is expiring. 
Since the Plan phase does not save any state, the Apply phase saves a different generated token, and the token generated during Plan ends up orphaned. 
It will expire in six hours.
