!> **Be Careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your project using
this resource. Deleting a hcp_project_iam_policy removes access from anyone
without organization-level access to the project. It is not recommended to use
hcp_project_iam_policy with your provider project to avoid locking yourself out,
and it should generally only be used with projects fully managed by Terraform.
If you are trying to additively give permissions to the project, prefer using
`hcp_project_iam_binding`. If you do use this resource, it is recommended to
import the policy before applying the change.

~> **Note:** `hcp_project_iam_policy` can not be used in conjunction with
