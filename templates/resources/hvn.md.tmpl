{{ .Description | trimspace }}

We recommend the following when selecting the CIDR block of an HVN:

- The CIDR block value must be a private IPv4 CIDR block within the [RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) address space (10.*.*.*, 192.168.*.*, 172.[16-31].*.*).

- The CIDR block value must be the first IP address of the desired CIDR block. The helper `cidrsubnet("172.16.1.1/24", 0, 0)` will specify the first address of the CIDR block in the first argument.

- The CIDR block value must end between /16 and /25.

- If the CIDR block values for your HVN and VPCs overlap, then you will not be able to establish a connection. Ensure that any VPCs you plan to connect do not have overlapping values.

- The default HVN CIDR block value does not overlap with the default CIDR block value for AWS VPCs (172.31.0.0/16). However, if you are planning to use this HVN in production, we recommend adding a custom value instead of using the default.
