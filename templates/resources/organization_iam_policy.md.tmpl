!> **Be Careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself and others out of your
organization using this resource. In general, this resource should only be used
with organizations fully managed by Terraform. If you are trying to additively
give permissions to the organization, prefer using
`hcp_organization_iam_binding`. If you do use this resource, it is recommended
to import the policy and carefully inspecting the planned changes before
applying.
