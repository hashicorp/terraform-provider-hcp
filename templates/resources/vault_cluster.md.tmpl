# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production Vault instances to prevent accidental cluster deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy the cluster, such as attempting to change the `hvn_id`. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/hcp_vault_cluster/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

-> **Note:** When establishing performance replication links between clusters in different HVNs, an HVN peering connection is required. This can be defined explicitly using an [`hcp_hvn_peering_connection`](hvn_peering_connection.md), or HCP will create the connection automatically (peering connections can be imported after creation using [terraform import](https://www.terraform.io/cli/import)). Note HVN peering [CIDR block requirements](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/hcp/network/routes#cidr-block-requirements).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" "examples/resources/hcp_vault_cluster/import.sh" }}
