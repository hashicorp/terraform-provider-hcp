# Peer an Azure VNet to a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN)

In order to connect Azure workloads to an HCP services, you must peer the VNet in which the workloads reside to the HVN in which the HCP service resides.
This is accomplished by using the `hcp_azure_peering_connection` resource to create a network peering between the HVN's VNet and your own VNet.

-> **Note:** The CIDR blocks of the HVN and the peer VNet cannot overlap.

-> **Note:** The Azure peering must be accepted by adding the HCP-supplied Application/Service Principal ID and associated custom role and role assignment in your Azure tenant. These must be completed by a User or Service Principal with the Azure AD API Permissions described [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs/resources/service_principal) and an AzureRM `_Owner_` or `_User Access Administrator_` role assignment over an appropriate scope where your Virtual Network resides. If the peering is not accepted in time or the AzureAD/AzureRM provider principals used with the Terraform config below do not have the appropriate permissions, this deployment will hang until the Terraform Run times out due to the `hcp_azure_peering_connection` data source that waits for the peering to be accepted.

## Peer an Azure VNet to an HVN - Gateway support

The following example shows how to connect Azure workloads to HCP HVNs which require [Hub-spoke network topology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?tabs=cli) utilizing an Azure VPN Gateway.

-> **Note:** Azure Hub/Spoke architecture support is in private beta. Please contact [HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us) for details.

Notable aspects of this configuration:
* When the `use_remote_gatways` parameter of the `hcp_azure_peering_connection` resource is set to `true`, the peering link from customer VNet to HVN is set with `AllowGatewayTransit` to `true`.

## Peer an Azure VNet to an HVN - Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) support

The following example shows how to connect Azure workloads to HCP HVNs which require [Hub-spoke network topology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?tabs=cli) utilizing an Azure Network Virtual Appliance.

-> **Note:** Azure Hub/Spoke architecture support is in private beta. Please contact [HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us) for details.

Notable aspects of this configuration:
* An Azure Firewall is used as the Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).
* A "Spoke" Virtual Network is included and peered to the "Hub" Virtual Network.
