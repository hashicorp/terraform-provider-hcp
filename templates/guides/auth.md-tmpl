# Authenticate with HCP using service principal credentials

The HCP provider accepts client credentials, which are obtained on the creation of a service principal key. 

Service principals and service principal keys can be created in the HCP Portal with an existing user account.

## Create a service principal

Navigate to the Access Control (IAM) page. Select the Service Principals tab and create a new service principal. Give it the role Contributor, since it will be writing resources.

## Create a service principal key

Once the service principal is created, navigate to its detail page by selecting its name in the list. Create a new service principal key.

-> **Note:** Save the client ID and secret returned on successful key creation. The client secret will not be available after creation.

## Two options to configure the provider 

Save the client ID and secret as the environment variables HCP_CLIENT_ID and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET. Or, configure the provider with the client ID and secret by copy-pasting the values directly into provider config.
