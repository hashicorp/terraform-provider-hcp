# Scale a cluster

Admins are able to use the provider to change a clusterâ€™s size or tier. There are a few limitations on cluster scaling:

- When scaling performance replicated Plus-tier clusters, be sure to keep the size of all clusters in the group in sync
- Scaling down to the Development tier from any production-grade tier is not allowed
- If you are using too much storage and want to scale down to a smaller size or tier, you will be unable to do so until you delete enough resources

### Scaling example

Initial Cluster:
