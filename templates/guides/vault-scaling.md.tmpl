# Scale a cluster

Admins are able to use the provider to change a clusterâ€™s size or tier. Scaling down to a Development tier from any production-grade tier is not allowed. In addition, if you are using too much storage and want to scale down to a smaller size or tier, you will be unable to do so until you delete enough resources.

### Scaling example
