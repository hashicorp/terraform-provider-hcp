# Managing HCP Packer Bucket IAM Policies

You can grant specific users, service principals, or groups contributor or admin level access to a specific HCP Packer bucket using either a `hcp_packer_bucket_iam_binding` or `hcp_packer_bucket_iam_policy` resource.  Whenever a user is invited to a project they will have read level access to all resources, but you can restrict which of the principals in your project can maintain specific buckets.

A resource's policy is a list of bindings to assign roles to multiple users, groups, or service principals. The `hcp_packer_bucket_iam_policy` resource sets the Bucket IAM policy and replaces any existing policy.

The following example assigns the role `contributor` to a user principal and a service principal for the `production` bucket.

The following example assigns role contriubtor for a service principal to the production bucket, and also preserves existing bindings.
