# Create a new Vault cluster and an admin token

Once you have an HVN, HCP Vault enables you to quickly deploy a Vault Enterprise cluster in AWS across a variety of environments while offloading the operations burden to the SRE experts at HashiCorp.
The cluster's admin token grants its bearer administrator access to the Vault cluster. It expires after 6 hours.
