# Federation with Auto HVN Peering

Once you have a HCP Consul cluster, you can create a new Consul cluster to federate with the existing one.
By providing `auto_hvn_to_hvn_peering` as a parameter on the secondary cluster, the HVNs are being peered
automatically ensuring full connectivity. This parameter only ever has to be provided on secondary clusters.

This example uses the `development` tier. There are restrictions for federating clusters, depending on the tier:

* `development`: allows multi-region and single-region federation with up to two secondary clusters
* `standard`: allows single-region federation without restrictions of the number of secondary clusters
* `plus`: allows multi-region federation without restrictions of the number of secondary clusters

Keep in mind that the account wide cluster limit applies to federation as well.
