# Federation with Auto HVN Peering

Once you have a HCP Consul cluster, you can create a new Consul cluster to federate with the existing one.
By providing `auto_hvn_to_hvn_peering` as a parameter on the secondary cluster, the HVNs are being peered
automatically ensuring full connectivity. This parameter only ever has to be provided on secondary clusters.
