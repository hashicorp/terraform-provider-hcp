```release-note:bug
Fixed several missing/incorrect implementations for the resource-level 
`project_id` attribute that could lead to undefined or undesirable behavior on 
some resources and data sources when the `project_id` attribute had been used 
and its most recent value was different from the provider-level `project_id`,
whether or not the attribute was still present in the configuration file.

NOTE: See associated PR for caveats on temporary regressions.
```

```release-note:deprecation
Setting the `project_id` attribute on `hcp_hvn_peering_connection` and 
`data.hcp_hvn_peering_connection` is now deprecated. The value of the field was 
required to match the project ID for `hvn_1` and will now be determined 
automatically. Remove the `project_id` field from the configuration for 
affected resources and data sources.
```

```release-note:deprecation
Setting the `hvn_2` attribute of `data.hcp_hvn_peering_connection` is now 
deprecated. The value of the attribute is not needed to fetch data, and it was 
never validated against the real value for `hvn_2`. The value will now be 
populated automatically. Remove the `hvn_2` attribute from the configuration 
for affected data sources.
```

```release-note:deprecation
Setting the `project_id` attribute on `hcp_hvn_route` and `data.hcp_hvn_route`
is now deprecated. The value of the field was required to match the project ID 
in `hvn_link` and will now be determined automatically. Remove the `project_id` 
field from the configuration for affected resources and data sources.
```
