```release-note:bug
Fixed several missing/incorrect implementations for the resource-level 
`project_id` attribute that could lead to undefined or undesirable behavior on 
some resources and data sources when the `project_id` attribute had been used 
and its most recent value was different from the provider-level `project_id`,
whether or not the attribute was still present in the configuration file.

NOTE: See associated PR for caveats on temporary regressions.
